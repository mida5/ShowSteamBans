# ShowSteamBans

Very small and simple Chrome Browser Plugin (Unpacked version). You can install it by activate "Developer mode" and press "Load unpacked" button.

Open your friends page in Steam (or blacklist), and people with VAC/Game ban would be colored. Recently banned is more highlighted.

No need to login in. So you no need to worry about your inventory. Beware, some plugins may steal your Inventory/Account if you logged.
